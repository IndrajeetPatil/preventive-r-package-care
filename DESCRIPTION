Description: This presentation contains my thoughts on how to build robust 
    automation infrastructure for R package development that can improve user 
    experience and make long-term package development more reliable and sustainable. 
    This is not a package, and the DESCRIPTION file is included to make it easier 
    to install required packages in GitHub Actions workflows.
