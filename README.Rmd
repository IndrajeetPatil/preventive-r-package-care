## Preventive Care for R Packages

<img src="media/preventive-care.jpeg" align="right" width="250" />

As an R package developer, if you ever lay awake in the bed wondering:

- if the users are having a bad experience while using the package,
- if you will receive the dreaded CRAN email about archival, and
- if you will be able to update the package in time,

then this presentation is for you! ðŸ˜Š
