# "Software engineering ought to produce sustainability." 
\- Mark Seemann (*Code That Fits in Your Head*)

# Target audience {.smaller}

As an R package developer, if you ever lay awake in the bed wondering:

- if the users are having a bad experience while using the package,
- if you will receive the dreaded CRAN email about archival, and
- if you will be able to update the package in time,

then this presentation is for you! 😊

# Before we begin

Don't miss the forest for the trees.

## {.smaller}

:::{.callout-important}

## It's not about the tools

I will rely heavily on GitHub as the hosting platform and GitHub Actions as the CI/CD framework. Even if you use neither, the broader takeaways should still be relevant. And, of course, you can implement the necessary checks with the tools you prefer.

:::

<br>

:::{.callout-note}

## It's not *just* about CRAN

Following the recommended practices will make packages more robust to CRAN checks, but that benefit is *incidental*. You can follow these practices even if you never plan to submit to CRAN. The goal here is to make user experience better and to reduce maintenance workload.

:::

<br>

:::{.callout-tip}

## It's not even about R

The practices outlined here are relevant to software development in any other programming language (just replace the package with module/library/etc.).

# Digging the pit of success

How can software engineering improve sustainability

## Be always release-ready {.smaller}

<!-- column layout -->

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='70%'}

Based on research, *Accelerate* (Nicole, Humble, & Kim, 2018) argue that the key difference between high-performing vs low-performing software teams is *the ability to make a release at the drop of a hat*.

For R packages, this translates to making sure that every commit on the `main`-branch is **release-ready**. 

That is, if you were asked to make a new release soon, you can be confident that the latest commit doesn't have any documentation issues, code quality issues, performance regressions, etc.

## Fighting software entropy {.smaller}

The biggest reason why a software project becomes unsustainable is the unchecked accumulation of complexity.

. . . 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='20%'}

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/engineer.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width='80%'}

**Software engineering is the active and conscious process of preventing complexity from growing.**

It provides the methodology to make sure that the software works as intended and to ensure that it stays that way.

:::

::::

. . . 

:::{style="font-size: 25px;"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='20%'}

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/checklist.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width='80%'}

Software development is an inherently complex process. To make it more manageable, we break it down into checklists of best practices—each designed to stave off complexity—so that we don't forget about them.

Following each item on a checklist is a small improvement, but constantly keeping an eye on internal quality prevents software entropy from setting in. Although software engineering is more than about automating this process, it is undoubtedly an important part of it.

Therefore, we want to make sure that, when combined across these sources, there are enough examples to cover a significant proportion of available functionality.

<!-- column layout -->

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='9%'}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("media/toolbox.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width='91%'}

Use [`{covr}`](https://covr.r-lib.org/){target='_blank'} to compute example code coverage (i.e. proportion of the source code that is executed when running examples in help pages and vignettes), and to ensure that it is above a certain threshold.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| code-line-numbers: false
package_coverage(type = c("examples", "vignettes"), commentDonttest = FALSE, commentDontrun = FALSE)
```

:::

::::

:::: {.columns}

```

:::

::: {.column width='91%'}

Use a [GHA workflow](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/statsExpressions/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-coverage-examples.yaml){target='_blank'} to automate checking that the code coverage via examples never drops below the chosen threshold.

:::

::::

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}

## Additional tips 

- The choice of threshold is subjective and context-sensitive. Chasing after 100% example code coverage is futile (since this would require exposing every exception in the examples).

- The examples not run or tested on CRAN can still be counted for computing code coverage.

- Vignettes not included in the package (the ones in `vignettes/` subdirectory or `.Rbuildignore`) will not contribute towards the code coverage. Ditto for `README`. You can adjust the threshold accordingly.

- You could also choose the threshold on a file basis (`covr::file_coverage()`)

## Additional tips 

- If you are starting a new project, create README using [`usethis::use_readme_rmd()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_readme_rmd.html).

- If you need to convert your existing `.md` to `.Rmd`, you are [currently](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1807) out of luck. You will need to do this manually.

- If the repo is not under active development, you can run the workflow on a [scheduled time](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule){target='_blank'} (e.g. once a week).

## Types of examples

Help pages for exported functions should contain examples illustrating their usage. But you can skip executing some examples (e.g. because they are too time-consuming) using any of the following tags:

|      Tag      | Run by `example()`? | Run by `R CMD check`? |
| :-----------: | :-----------------: | :-------------------: |
| `\dontrun{}`  |         ❌          |          ❌           |
| `\donttest{}` |         ✅          |          ❌           |
| `\dontshow{}` |         ✅          |          ✅           |

Thus, broken `\dontrun{}` and `\donttest{}` examples may not be flagged by `R CMD check`. Users will still see these examples, and wonder why they aren't working for them.

CRAN's additional ["donttest" check](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/donttest/){target='_blank'} does run `\donttest{}` examples.

    * `if (FALSE) { ... }` (if example is included only for illustrative purposes)
    * `try({ ... })` (if the intent is to show the error)

## Types of vignettes

Vignettes included in the package will fail if examples are broken. But you can choose to exclude some vignettes to reduce package size or to reduce check time. You can do so by placing them in a `vignettes/` subdirectory or by adding them to `.Rbuildignore`.

## Types of conditions/exceptions

A function can use [conditions](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/conditions.html) to signal that something unexpected has happened with varying severity.

| Condition | Severity |                         Meaning                          |
| :-------: | :------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
|  `error`  |   high   |  execution stopped because there was no way to continue  |
| `warning` |  medium  |     execution encountered some problem but recovered     |
| `message` |   low    | execution was successful and here are some extra details |

:::

:::

::::

Out of these, warnings are the most nebulous! 

- Errors bring functions to a halt and you *must* attend to them. 
- Messages are innocuous and you *can* be safely ignored. 
- But warnings are harbingers of problems that you will need to fix at some point. They *need* to be dealt with, pronto, and yet it is easy to ignore them.

## A needle in the haystack {.smaller}

:::{.callout-note}

## Types of warnings

There are two kinds of warnings that you, as a developer, will need to deal with:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}

**Intrinsic warnings**

Warnings that functions in your package produce to inform users.
E.g. if your package has a function to winsorize data with a certain threshold, this could be a possible warning.

```{r}
#| eval: false
winsorize(x, threshold = c(0.3, 2))
#> Warning message:
#> `threshold` for winsorization must be a scalar between 0 and 0.5.
```

:::

::: {.column width='50%'}

**Extrinsic warnings**

Warnings coming from dependencies you are using, either in examples or tests.
E.g. if your package relies on `{ggplot2}`, you might get a warning like this.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_line(size = 1)
#> Warning message:
#> Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.
#> ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.
```

:::

<!-- column layout -->

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='10%'}

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("media/cleaning.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width='90%'}

With a significant amount of package functionality and dependencies, there can be plenty of warnings that at any given moment.

To avoid missing out on important warnings, there should ideally be **zero of either type of warning** in your package documentation and tests. This makes it easy to notice and deal with new warnings as they appear.

:::

::::

## Suppressing intrinsic warnings {.smaller}

There is almost never a need to explicitly highlight warnings intrinsic to your package.

. . .

::: {style="background-color: #FFDCA9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 25px;"}

- Warnings are generated in contexts where functions in *your* package were used unexpectedly by the users. But such contexts shouldn't be deliberately highlighted in the documentation. Users should always see [happy path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path){target='_blank'} examples in help pages, README, or vignettes.

- While testing functions, you should use expectations (e.g. `testthat::expect_warning()`) to check that expected warnings are triggered. You shouldn't print the warnings, since they can completely overwhelm the test log, which makes it difficult to catch important warnings.

- If it's a complex package function that can encounter a large number of slippery situations, it makes sense for you to provide an argument to turn off a few warnings (e.g. `verbose = FALSE`) and use it to omit warnings in the docs.

:::

## Suppressing extrinsic warnings {.smaller}

Warnings from dependencies can be critical and should be dealt with ASAP.

. . .

::: {style="background-color: #FFFBC1; padding: 20px; border-radius: 25px;"}

- If dependencies are emitting warnings because your functions are using imported code in unexpected ways, rewrite functions to remove warnings.

- If the warnings are about deprecated functions or arguments, switch to using the suggested alternatives. Don't wait until they are removed.

- Some warnings are unavoidable and not as important. They can be suppressed using `suppressWarnings()`. That said, avoid using it in examples in help pages, lest users think that this is part of *your* package API.

- If the warnings are coming from somewhere upstream (e.g. `{ggplot2}` → `{ggside}` → your package), you have little control over them. You can inform the upstream maintainer and ignore such warnings using `suppressWarnings()`. Don't forget to remove suppress calls once the warnings are fixed upstream.

:::

::::

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}

## Additional tips 

- While you are at this cleanup, it might also be worth clean up intrinsic and extrinsic messages. They might be harmless, but they do clog up logs and make it difficult to focus on warnings.

- If you set `warning=FALSE` in vignettes, note that this only suppresses warnings in the rendered output. When your users run this code interactively, they are still going to see the suppressed warnings. [Ostrich policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich_policy){target='_blank'} never works for software development.

You (the developer) may be developing the package in a certain setting: with a certain version of R, on a particular OS, in a certain locale, etc. Even if all tests pass and all examples run successfully for you locally, you can't assume that your users will use the package in similar settings.

If you restrict your checks only to run on these specific settings, you may not anticipate the problems your users may experience in other settings (e.g., the graphics device that works on `windows` may not work on `macOS`, code that works with `R 4.1` may not work with `R 3.6`, etc.). 

:::{style="font-size: 20px;"}

- Fully crossed checks (all major platforms $\times$ all supported R versions) are rarely necessary and definitely an overkill.

- Ideally, the package should be tested until the oldest R version it purports to support. E.g. if `DESCRIPTION` says `R >= 3.4`, then you should check until `R 3.4` to make sure that the package indeed works for this R version. If you check only until `R 3.5`, it is instead better to bump version in `DESCRIPTION`.

The physical layout of the program can assist the reader in understanding the underlying logic. Additionally, understanding a large codebase is easier to follow when all the code has consistent formatting. Style guides outline conventions to enforce a uniform formatting schema across the codebase.

Style guides can be highly opinionated and some arbitrary. So, more important than *which* style guide you follow is the fact that you follow *a* style guide.

Checking for performance regressions just before or even after the release is not ideal, since it might be difficult to revert back to the state before regression took place.

# Dependency management

Preventive care to make sure that all suggested (aka weak or soft) dependencies are used conditionally.

Dependencies (code that your source code relies on) are an inevitable part of package development.

:::

::::

. . . 

:::{.callout-note}

## Not all dependencies are created equal! 

Hard dependencies have a broader scope because they are needed at runtime; i.e. your package won't work without them, while soft dependencies have a narrow scope; e.g. because they are needed only for testing or for examples.

| Dependency |  In `DESCRIPTION`   |                        Scope                        |
| :--------: | :-----------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
|    Hard    | `Depends`/`Imports` |    Needed for your package to work as expected.     |
|    Soft    |     `Suggests`      | Nice to have but your package will work regardless. |

:::

:::{.callout-important}

## Dependencies bring risk

If a critical dependency becomes unavailable (e.g. because its author decides to archive it), bad luck. You **must** either refactor to remove dependency or look for an alternative. Otherwise, your package is no longer going to work. But this shouldn't be the case for soft dependencies since they are not critical for your package to work.

:::

In a high-level, user-facing package, there can be a substantial number of soft dependencies, and the package risks breakage for *any* unavailable soft dependency, if not used conditionally.

It can be quite taxing for maintainers to remove examples or tests related to a soft dependency if gets archived, and restore them once the dependency is unarchived. To avoid this, soft dependencies should always be used conditionally.

:::{style="font-size: 20px;"}

CRAN runs the additional ["noSuggests" check](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/noSuggests/){target='_blank'} to look for possible breakages.

The trick here is to run `R CMD check` twice: Once when *all* soft dependencies are available, and once when *none* are available. If the package passes the `R CMD check` in the first but not the second context, you can be sure that some soft dependencies are not being used conditionally.

Use GHA workflows to install [*all* dependencies](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/check-full.yaml){target='_blank'} or [*only* hard dependencies](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/check-no-suggests.yaml){target='_blank'} and check if the package passes `R CMD check` on each commit.

:::

::::

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}

## Additional tips 

- This trick won't work for excluded vignettes (from `vignettes/` subdirectory or `.Rbuildignore`-ed). To ensure that excluded vignettes are using soft dependencies conditionally, run `{pkgdown}` in ["noSuggests" mode](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/statsExpressions/blob/main/.github/workflows/pkgdown-no-suggests.yaml){target='_blank'}.

- For `R CMD check` with all dependencies installed, use [strict workflow](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/statsExpressions/blob/main/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check-strict.yaml){target='_blank'} that fails on any `NOTE`. To avoid failing on `NOTE`s accepted by CRAN, include this in `DESCRIPTION`:

```dcf
Config/rcmdcheck/ignore-inconsequential-notes: true
```

## Anticipating breakages {.smaller}

It is important to anticipate changes in dependencies that may break your packages. Although some maintainers (of your dependencies) will be kind enough to let you know of upcoming breaking changes, such communication can't be assumed or might not even be possible. 

:::{style="font-size: 20px;"}

If your package is not on CRAN, there is no way for the maintainers to detect breakages in reverse dependencies and inform maintainers. Similarly, if a reverse dependency is skipping tests on CRAN, possible breakages can go undetected. 

:::

:::

::: {.column width='90%'}

You may figure out that something is broken *after* a dependency is updated, the package stops working for the users, and they inform you. This is especially true if your package is not under active development, and so CI/CD won't detect that your package is broken.

Use scheduled [GHA workflow](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/statsExpressions/blob/main/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check-devel.yaml){target='_blank'} to automate checking breakages.

:::{style="font-size: 20px;"}

How frequently you should run this check (e.g., once a month, once every six months, etc.) and which dependencies you should include (e.g., only hard, only soft, a few of each, etc.) depends on how actively both your own package and your dependencies are being developed. 

:::

:::

::::

. . .

<br>

:::{.callout-tip}

## What should you do if you *do* detect a breakage?

- If the root cause of breakage turns out to be a regression in the dependency, discuss with the maintainer.

- If the breakage is legitimate, make a PR to your repo with a fix but merge only when either the maintainer informs you of an upcoming release or the package has a new release. **Don't** push the fix to the `main`-branch because the breaking change could be reverted before release.

# Eco-friendly workflows

Do you *really* need to run all workflows on each commit?!

## Skipping workflows {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='70%'}

Although all these workflows can be run for free (thanks Microsoft!), they still expend energy and it might bother you that you are wasting energy even on minor changes.

:::

::: {.column width='30%'}

:::{style="font-size: 20px;"}

Example of an insignificant change.

:::

```diff
# In `NEWS.md`
- witdh
+ width
```

:::

::::

. . . 

:::{.callout-tip}

## Reducing count of workflow runs

You can use a few or all of the following options to reduce the frequency with which the workflows are run.

- Use `[skip ci]` in your commit messages for commits with insignificant changes.
- Run workflows only when a PR is marked "Ready for Review".
- Skip running some workflows (e.g., spelling, HTML5, link rot, etc.) on each commit once all workflows are green. Instead, run them with weekly or monthly schedules, and then fix the newly found problems.
- Run some workflows only when ready for a new release.
- Cancel [workflows in progress](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency){target="_blank"} if a new commit is made.

:::

# Caveats

No good practice is dogma. There always exist exceptions.

## Using workflows flexibly {.smaller}

- You can skip some workflows or create new workflows depending on the project-specific demands (e.g. compiled code, database connections, API access, etc.).

- Sometimes it might not even be possible to run all workflows successfully because a few of them conflict with each other. 

  :::{style="font-size: 20px;"}
  
  If you have a data visualization package (e.g.), the more examples you have in the documentation, the bigger the package size would be, which might leave a `NOTE` in `R CMD check` and strict workflow will fail. Which of these workflows is more important is a subjective decision.
