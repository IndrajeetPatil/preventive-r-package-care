# "Software engineering ought to produce sustainability."

# Who is this presentation for?

Specifying the intended audience early-on to check relevance of the content for you.

## Before we begin

:::{.callout-important}

## Don't miss the forest for the trees

In this presentation, I will rely heavily on GitHub as the hosting platform and GitHub Actions as the CI/CD framework. But, if you use neither, don't feel that this is not relevant for you.

At the end of each section, I will include broader takeaways that are independent of the exact tech stack used for development. You can implement them with whatever tools you prefer.
